3. Check if user is logged in or not and serve the game accordingly.
4. Add the friend widget where a user can add friends. ->Future developments
5. Live chat funcitonality. ->Future developements
6. Scoring funcitonlity.
7. In Assign the unique element always pick a random number instead of the element
   which is found first.
8. REFACTOR THE CODE.
9. Check for the cluster after the moving of elements.
10. When we are moving the elements and redrawing the elements, decide the
    time interval from the server side instead of the client side because sometimes
    when we have the vertical and horizontal clusters together it will always
    clear the animation in shorter time.
12. Comment and use constants on the gamePage and animation functions
