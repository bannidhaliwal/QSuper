          Superannuation is a way to save up for your retirement days.
          The money will comes from contributions that are made into your super fund by your
          employer and ideally by your own money. You can get other benefits, such as co-contribution
          that are added by the government and the low income super contribution.
          The rule is that your employer must give Super Guarantee by contributing 9.5% of
          your salary to a super fund. The Super Guarantee rate will gradually increase to 12% in coming years.
          As time goes on, these contributions that comes from your employer and your own money
          will add up. Your super money is also used by super fund to invest to other things so it grows over
          time. When you reached the age of retirement, you will have money to live off. Super is a lifetime investment
          that gives you many benefits and security.
